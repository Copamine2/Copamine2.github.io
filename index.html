    <center><h1>i am the funny website guy. i make websites</h1></center>
    <p>i make websites, and people want websites. so i simply want to make websites for people. this website is made purly to show my skills and to give information on how you can get a website of your own.</p>


    <a href="http://click-that-button.glitch.me">website 1: click that button</a> <br><br><p>click that button is a funny website i made a while back from a suggestion from a friend. it basically is a button that counts every time it was clicked, ever, from any device. leaderboards exist, and custom names too. i personally think that this website was a really fun one to make.</p>

<br><br>
    <a href="http://copamine.itch.io/bda">website 2: buare depression adventures</a> <br><br><p>this isnt a website any more, but it started out as one. it technically is still a website, as it uses html, javascript, and css code, it just happens to be hosted on itch at the time. its not nearly done, but its a game i worked on for a while and still am working on sometimes.</p>

    <br><br>

    <a href="http://funihahasite.glitch.me">website 3: funi haha site</a> <br><br><p>(NEW INFO: DO NOT USE THIS ON FIRE FOX! IT WILL CRASH YOUR DEVICE!) so this website is a weird one. i made it a while back as a joke. the entire website just has a button that when clicked shows your IP address and device info, followed by the website killing itself. the website doesnt actually save any of your information, it just shows it to you and kills itself. i had fun with this one.</p>

    <br><br>

    <a href="http://tfw.glitch.me">website 4: the false weekly</a> <br><br><p>this used to be my favorite website, as it was sort of like <i>The Onion</i> in the form of completely false news. it was a thing i did with my friends where we wrote articles every week for absolutely absurd things. sadly, with lack of free time, the website has not updated in about 6 months. it is very sad to see, but it was great while it lasted. it still has some stuff left to show, though.</p>

    <p>so im Asher, an indie web developer, and i just wanna make some cool stuff. i personally am running out of ideas and i want to both make cool things and help others, so this feels like the right thing to do. ive been working with computers for about 6-7 years now, but ive been coding websites for 3. i do some IT sometimes and i just enjoy technological things. everything ive learned with coding is self taught, back when i had way too much free time. okay cool thats enough about me.</p>

    <p>so i have a few ways to get to me. my discord, which im on every once in a while, is "@copamine_". my "work" email is copaminepublic@gmail.com, and i have a form for people who want to do that instead. just tell me you saw this and about what you want, and ill get back to you as soon as i can. im not free often anymore, so im not able to make things super quickly. i dont really charge anything for this, unless its a really big ask in which i will, but other than that its relatively free. im not some top tier web developer, so im not amazing, but i can do quite a bit. again, thank you for reading all this, and if you consider contacting me, that would be amazing.</p>
